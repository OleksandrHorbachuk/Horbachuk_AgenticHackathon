# Architecture Overview

Our agent, the "Color-Mood Analyzer," follows a classic Planner-Executor design pattern to perform a multi-step, creative task. The entire system is powered by the Google Gemini API.

## Components

1. **User Interface**  
   - Our agent uses a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** to receive user input and display the final output.  

2. **Agent Core**  
   - **Planner**: The `planner.py` module uses the Gemini API to break down the user's goal into a sequential plan of three sub-tasks: `Colorizer`, `SentimentAnalyzer`, and `Synthesize`.  
   - **Executor**: The `executor.py` module acts as the coordinator. It contains the logic for calling specialized tool functions based on the plan. The executor's context is passed from step to step, allowing data to flow through the system.  
   - **Memory**: The agent does not use an explicit memory module. Instead, it uses a **short-term context** (`context` dictionary) to pass the results of a previous step (e.g., the list of colors) to the next step.  

3. **Tools / APIs**  
   - All three tools of our agent (`Colorizer`, `SentimentAnalyzer`, `Synthesize`) are implemented as specialized functions that make targeted requests to the **Google Gemini API**. We do not rely on any other external APIs.  

4. **Observability**  
   - We have basic logging implemented via `print` statements in the `planner.py` and `executor.py` files to show which step is being executed.  
   - Error handling is included via `try...except` blocks in the tool functions to catch and report API errors gracefully.
