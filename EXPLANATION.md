# Technical Explanation

## 1. Agent Workflow

Our agent processes an input by following a sequential, multi-step chain of thought:
1. **Receive user input**: The `main.py` script prompts the user for text.
2. **(Optional) Retrieve relevant memory**: This agent does not use a memory store, as it performs a stateless, one-off task.
3. **Plan sub-tasks**: The `planner.py` module uses the Gemini API to break the user's goal into a linear, 3-step plan.
4. **Call tools or APIs as needed**: The `executor.py` module iterates through the plan and calls one of three tools: `Colorizer`, `SentimentAnalyzer`, or `Synthesize`.
5. **Summarize and return final output**: The `Synthesize` tool compiles all the results and formats them into a final report, which is then printed to the console.

## 2. Key Modules

- **Planner** (`planner.py`): This moduleâ€™s core function is to generate a step-by-step plan. It uses a single, targeted prompt to the Gemini API to get a structured list of sub-tasks.
- **Executor** (`executor.py`): This module is the coordinating brain of the agent. It contains the logic to parse a plan step, identify the correct tool, and execute it. It also manages the flow of data, passing the output of one tool as the input to the next.
- **Memory Store** (`memory.py`): This module was not implemented in our project. The agent uses a simple in-memory context dictionary (`previous_results`) to pass data between steps, which is sufficient for this specific workflow.

## 3. Tool Integration

All tools in our agent are implemented as specialized prompts to the **Google Gemini API**. This is a deliberate design choice that showcases the model's versatility.
- **`Colorizer`**: A function that calls the Gemini API with a prompt to associate each word in a text with a color.
- **`SentimentAnalyzer`**: A function that takes a list of colors and calls the Gemini API to infer the overall mood. It operates "blindly" on the color data alone.
- **`Synthesize`**: A function that calls the Gemini API to format the original text, color list, and sentiment into a final, human-readable report.

## 4. Observability & Testing

Our agent includes basic observability to make its workflow transparent:
- **Logging**: We use `print` statements in the `planner.py` and `executor.py` files to show which step is being executed and what data is being processed.
- **Error Handling**: Each tool function includes a `try...except` block to gracefully handle potential API errors and prevent the agent from crashing.

## 5. Known Limitations

- **Subjectivity**: The results are not deterministic. The color associations and sentiment analysis are creative and probabilistic, which is a feature that highlights the LLM's strengths but means the output is not always consistent.
- **Performance**: The agent relies on multiple sequential API calls to the Gemini API, making the overall process slower than a single-function call.
- **Statelessness**: The agent does not have a long-term memory and cannot remember previous conversations or analyses.
