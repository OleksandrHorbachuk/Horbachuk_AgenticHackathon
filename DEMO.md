# Demo Video

Project Introduction: The video introduces the "Color-Mood Analyzer Agent," a project designed to creatively analyze text sentiment by translating words into colors.

Agent Architecture: The video explains the agent's core architecture, highlighting the planner for task decomposition, the executor for running tools, and main.py as the overall orchestrator.

Tool Integration: The demonstration showcases how the agent's tools work in a multi-step process, with a Colorizer encoding text into colors and a separate SentimentAnalyzer decoding mood from the colors alone.

End-to-End Demo: The video concludes with a live walkthrough, showing the agent successfully planning, executing, and presenting a final report on the analyzed text's mood.
